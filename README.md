Utilized the iterative approach of Newton's method to converge towards a root.
Incorporated parameters such as the function, its derivative, initial guess, tolerance, and maximum iterations.
Implemented a while loop to iterate until either the desired tolerance is achieved or the maximum number of iterations is reached.
Displayed the approximate root with a precision of 10 decimal places.
